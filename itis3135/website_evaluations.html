		<h2>Website Evaluation</h2>
		
		<section>
		<h3><a href="https://www.freshprints.com/home">Fresh Prints</a></h3>
		<p>This is the official website for Fresh Prints, an apparel company that targets college campuses.
		In addition to selling all sorts of apparel Fresh Prints also gets students involved through their 
		Campus Manager position. They offer competitve prices and are licensed to operate on most colleges
		in the UNC system.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>C - The Fresh Prints website has great consistency! Its very easy to tell the difference between 
			elements on the page. For example the text is bold and contrast nicely with the background and 
			the clickable images are all in rectangles.</li>
			<li>R - The repition on this page is also very good. All the headers use the same font and color as
			well as the small paragraphs. As I mentioned previously, the images are also all in the same
			rectangular format. Overall very professional looking!</li>
			<li>A - All the headings and text boxes are aligned to the center of the page and the images are
			also alighned vertically.</li>
			<li>P - All the information is grouped with a heading and all the images of apparel are grouped together.
			Great proximity all around!</li>
		
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>C - Its hard to tell the difference between the text and the background on certain parts of this 
			page. The fact that the page is also moving constantly makes it even worse.</li>
			<li>R - The only element repition in this page are the green text boxes, otherwise the page uses a lot
			of random colors and font sizes.</li>
			<li>A - Most of the text boxes are aligned on the left side of the screen, but other than that
			everything is very jumbled up on the left side of the screen.</li>
			<li>P - Everything is jumbled together and its hard to tell the difference between elements just
			based on their proximity.</li>
