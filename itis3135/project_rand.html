		<h2>Project Design</h2>
			
			<h3>Project Overview</h3>
			
			<p>
			The purpose of this application is to serve as a portfolio for my client. 
			The intended users of this client will exclusively be my client and potential 
			employers the client decides to share the portfolio with. The client has 
			laid out that they would like the website to include a bio that she will provide, 
			work history, pictures of what she has accomplished in her career, and her resume.	
			</p>
